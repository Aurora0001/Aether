        <h2>Conversations, made easy</h2>
        <p>
          Aether supports <span class="highlight">everything that you're used
          to</span> in a chat client; it's simple to start a private
          conversation or join a public channel and chat with others.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can use as many emoji as you like, and have them rendered
          <span class="highlight">beautifully</span> in the client - no need to
          stick to boring ASCII emotes.
