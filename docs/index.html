      <h2>
        A beautiful and practical IRC client with all the features you'd
        expect from a modern chat platform.

        <h2>Conversations, made easy</h2>
        <p>
          Aether supports <span class="highlight">everything that you're used
          to</span> in a chat client; it's simple to start a private
          conversation or join a public channel and chat with others. Since
          Aether uses the IRC protocol, you can chat with over
          <span class="highlight">450,000 people</span> in
          <span class="highlight">250,000 channels!</span>
          <sup><a href="http://irc.netsplit.de/">[1]</a></sup>
        </p>
        <h3>First-class Emoji Support</h3>
        <p>
          You can use as many emoji as you like, and have them rendered
          <span class="highlight">beautifully</span> in the client - no need to
          stick to boring ASCII emotes.
        </p>
        <h3>The Visual Element</h3>
        <p>
          Aether uses <span class="highlight">bold, visually distinct</span>
          colours to identify users and their permissions. With this, it's no
          problem to distinguish between two users with similar nicknames.

        <h2>Find anything, any time</h2>
        <p>
          Aether supports <span class="highlight">searching all of your messages
          </span>simply, using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>
          (or <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> on macOS). You'll never have to
          waste valuable time searching for links or messages that were sent
          previously with Aether.
        </p>
        <h3>Browse through your logs</h3>
        <p>
          Aether automatically logs IRC messages for you, so that you can find
          and use them at any time. Since the logs are just files, you can also
          import them into other programs or modify them with a text editor.

        <h2>Extensible and Adjustable</h2>
        <p>
          Aether comes with an <span class="highlight">extensive plugin system</span>
          that allows you to tweak almost any aspect of the client. All the
          changes you see in the UI can be adjusted through plugins simply
          and easily.
        </p>
        <h3>Drag in your files</h3>
        <p>
          Aether can <span class="highlight">automatically upload files</span>
          that you drag-and-drop into the client so you can share screenshots,
          code snippets and logs without having to manually copy the data,
          upload it to a file hosting service and then copy in the link.
        </p>
        <p>
          By default, Aether will upload images to Imgur, and text files to
          GitHub Gist. Other plugins are available to handle different file
          types if neither of the above suit you.
