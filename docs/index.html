        <h2>Conversations, made easy</h2>
        <p>
          Aether supports <span class="highlight">everything that you're used
          to</span> in a chat client; it's simple to start a private
          conversation or join a public channel and chat with others. Since
          Aether uses the IRC protocol, you can chat with over
          <span class="highlight">450,000 people</span> in
          <span class="highlight">250,000 channels!</span>
          <sup><a href="http://irc.netsplit.de/">[1]</a></sup>
        </p>
        <h3>First-class Emoji Support</h3>
        <p>
          You can use as many emoji as you like, and have them rendered
          <span class="highlight">beautifully</span> in the client - no need to
          stick to boring ASCII emotes.
        </p>
        <h3>The Visual Element</h3>
        <p>
          Aether uses bold, visually distinct colours to identify users and
          their permissions. With this, it's no problem to distinguish between
          two users with similar nicknames.
