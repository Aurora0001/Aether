    ## Conversations, made easy

    Aether supports *everything that you're used to* in a chat client; it's
    simple to start a private conversation or join a public channel and chat
    with others. Since Aether uses the IRC protocol, you can chat with over
    *450,000 people* in *250,000 channels!* [[1]](http://irc.netsplit.de)


    You can use as many emoji as you like, and have them rendered
    *beautifully* in the client - no need to stick to boring ASCII emotes.


    Aether uses *bold, visually distinct* colours to identify users and their
    permissions. With this, it's no problem to distinguish between two users
    with similar nicknames.

    ## Find anything, any time

    Aether supports *searching all of your messages* simply, using
    <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> (or <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> on macOS).
    You'll never have to waste valuable time searching for links or messages
    that were sent previously with Aether.


    Aether automatically logs IRC messages for you, so that you can find
    and use them at any time. Since the logs are just files, you can also
    import them into other programs or modify them with a text editor.

    ## Extensible and Adjustable

    Aether comes with an *extensive plugin system* that allows you to tweak
    almost any aspect of the client. All the changes you see in the UI can be
    adjusted through plugins simply and easily.


    Aether can *automatically upload files* that you drag-and-drop into the
    client so you can share screenshots, code snippets and logs without having
    to manually copy the data, upload it to a file hosting service and
    then copy in the link.
    

    By default, Aether will upload images to Imgur, and text files to
    GitHub Gist. Other plugins are available to handle different file
    types if neither of the above suit you.
