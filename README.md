## Motivation and Design
Since its creation in 1988, IRC has been one of the greatest and most widely
supported chat protocols ever. However, IRC clients themselves have barely
changed, looking almost no different from 10 years ago, and only barely
different from the oldest clients such as ircII.

Aether aims to change that. We set out to create a modern, user-friendly
client that would be aesthetically pleasing, while remaining practical and
streamlined so that it's still easy to chat with others. In addition to all of
this, we wanted to make the client cross-platform, fast and easy to set up.

To achieve this goal, Aether uses Electron, a framework for cross-platform
applications written in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
